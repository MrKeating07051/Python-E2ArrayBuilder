# Python-E2ArrayBuilder
A python script which converts raw source model text file lists into E2-compatible arrays.

I simultaneously learned how to code python while writing this, so I'm very happy how it came out!

Go from:
Abc
bcA
cAb

To:
E2_Array = array(
"Abc",
"bcA",
"cAb"
)

in just a few keystrokes!

Try running this script with the "tf2_models_example.txt".
